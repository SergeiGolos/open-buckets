# Notes:
# 1. Patterns are relative to the working directory where open-buckets is run
# 2. Global config can be placed at ~/.config/open-buckets/.bucket-include
# 3. Local .bucket-include takes precedence over global config
# 4. Use ** for recursive directory matching (e.g., src/**/*.js)
# 5. Use * for single-level matching (e.g., *.js)
